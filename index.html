            <h4>Traditional Artists:</h4>
            <p> As a painter many of my favourite artists use traditional mediums such as paint and pencil, one of my biggest inspirations from an early age has been the artist, Francis Bacon. He’s an untrained oil painter whose work is very dark and eerie, I especially like the work he produced between the 40s and 50s, they feel raw and unnerving and that’s a feeling I've always been interested in exploring within my own work. The work of Jean-Michel Basquiat has also been a big influence on my mark making and colour choices, as well as the drawings of Paul McCarroll. One of my biggest influences has also been the Polish artist Zdzislaw Beksinski, who creates nightmarish depictions of a post-apocalyptic world. I love his style and the colours he uses in his pieces.

            <h4>Ai Artists</h4>
            <p>Within the world of creative Ai and coding I have come across a large number of artists and programmers who are wildly interesting and inspiring to me. One large example is the artist Sofia Crespo who works with Biology-inspired Technologies to create her work, one of my favourite projects of hers is a collection of videos called “Critically Extinct” that showcase generated images of endangered species. Other artists of interest include Douggy Pledger who creates grotesque Ai generated portraits and artwork, the fashion designer Iris Van Herpen who utilises technologies like 3D printing and robotics to create alien like garments. Finally the "Cloud Painter" collection by artist Pindar Van Arman is a project that I've been interested in for a while. A face is studied, and reimagined by neural networks and then physically painted by robotic arms, the entire process is far more complicated than that but the results are increadible and the project starts a lot of conversations about what art means and who makes it.

                <h4>Inspirations</h4>
                <p>I’m very inspired and interested in the different ways the human body and anatomy can be explored through art, bodies are so different and the experience of having a body varies between everyone as well so no two experiences will be exactly the same. Daisy Collingridge’s squishy fabric sculptures have always been interesting to me because they look soft and inviting yet mutated and alien. The digital work of Dan Peacock also fits into the category of mutated humanoids, his digital paintings are fascinating and so interesting to look at. I love the way he makes the human form so hideous and unnatural he’s also extremely talented, it’s fun to simply study his work. I’m also a big fan of the colours used in the works of both Dan Huston and Andrew Cadima, they use bright, vibrant colours and interesting brush strokes/pencil lines that make their pieces enjoyable to look at and study.
